//Important: We can not pass as an argument a pointer to a function of an object. 
//We need to have the object first in order to run the function.
//What we can do is telling TS to keep the function binded to its object, and not take it out of the object
//we use bind to connect the function to its object


//First, authMiddleware is running to check if user is authenticated. If this function calls next()
//then the function which is passed as the 3rd argument will be executed
